          The Customer Support team was having a problem with our contact form.
          They were overwhelmed with an increasing volume of spam submissions.
          We were using Perimeter X, but they were still getting as many as 100
          messages per day. Many of these messages were nothing more than
          keyboard mashing. They asked me if I could create a filter to protect
          them from these type of submissions.
